Ginny's Homepage
=============
This is Ginny Huang's official homepage, which basically means an interactive and
less formal resume. I haven't modified this for a while, and some of the contents may 
be out of date. I am going to update it asap.

Next steps: 

1. In the right of "Contact" block, add links to create pull request and issue tracker. Also, put an arrow in the "Back to top" button
2. The "Personal" field will let us play a game (either answering questions about me or play Minesweeper)
3. Project field would be divided into three parts: Java, Web and Mobile (Stacked nav-pills?)
4. Experience part ... Hmm I don't want it to work like a resume though, any ideas?

This page is always underconstruction.
