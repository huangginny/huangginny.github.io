Ginny's Homepage
=============
This is Ginny Huang's official homepage, which basically means an interactive and
less formal resume. I haven't modified this for a while, and some of the contents may 
be out of date. I am going to update it asap.

Next steps: 
+ 1. Re-arrange the boxes using bootstrap to avoid unnecessary css;
+ 2. Use FontAwesome for social network links;
+ 3. Remove "Link"

This page is always underconstruction.
