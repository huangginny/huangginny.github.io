Ginny's Homepage
=============
This is Ginny Huang's official homepage, which basically means an interactive and
less formal resume. I haven't modified this for a while, and some of the contents may 
be out of date. I am going to update it asap.

Next steps: 

1. The "Personal" field will let us play a game (either answering questions about me or play Minesweeper)
2. Project field would be divided into three parts: Java, Web and Mobile (Stacked nav-pills?)
3. Experience part ... Hmm I don't want it to work like a resume though, any ideas?

This page is always underconstruction.
